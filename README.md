A short standalone (but soon-to-be-command!) script to download github releases and automatically place/name them wherever/whatever you like! Why? Because I am lazy.

Written in entirely in bash, it should be able to run on any UNIX-Like system, and even on Windows through WSL (not tested)
(And yes, you can even use it to download the script itself.)

Make sure to configure the script once it has been downloaded, and only change the User Defined Variables.
