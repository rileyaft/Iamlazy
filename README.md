A short standalone (but soon-to-be-command!) script to download github releases and automatically place/name them wherever/whatever you like! Why? Because I am lazy.

Written in entirely in bash, it should be able to run on any UNIX-Like system, and even on Windows through WSL!

(And yes, you can even use it to download the script itself ðŸ™ƒ)

# Instructions
Make sure to configure the script once it has been downloaded, and only change the User Defined Variables.
Example configs are as follows below!
```bash
# User Variables
YOUR_TOKEN="98374982347cfh23847f298f4792dh429" # IMPORTANT: your Github API access key, make one at "https://github.com/settings/tokens"
REPO="Iamlazy" # repo to grab from
OWNER="rileyaft" # owner of repo
DIRECTORY="/home/rileyaft/Applications" # desired file output (WILL REPLACE EXISTING FILE IF PRESENT)
FILE="tar.gz" # desired application file extension grabbed from releases, ie "7z"
NAME="Iamlazy" # application will be named this once complete
```
Ensure the directory is listed directly from ```/```, otherwise ```mv``` tends to struggle.

# To-do
> allow automatic decompression of zip/7z/tar.gz/etc files

> make this an actual system package

> further customization

> separate config file

> Qt6 GUI?

> WORLD DOMINATION
